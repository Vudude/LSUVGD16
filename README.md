How to use git with command line.

git clone https://github.com/Vudude/LSUVGD16.git

to intially get the project. Open the project folder in Unity and everything should be fine.

git branch "whatever the name of the branch is"

in order to create a branch.

git checkout "the name of the branch" 

in order to change to a particular branch.
Once in the branch, you can work on the project.

After making changes, use

git commit

to commit the changes to your LOCAL repo and then

git push

to push the changes to the actual web repo for everyone else.
Then you can go on the git project and make a pull request if your change is basically final. Don't merge the pull request yourself let someone else look it over.
